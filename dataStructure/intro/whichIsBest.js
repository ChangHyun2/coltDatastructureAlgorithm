data structure
- collections of values
- relationships among them
- functions or operations that can be applied to the data
- different data structures excel at differnt things.

There is no one the best datastructure
they all excel in different situations...

ex) working with map/location data? >> use a graph!
ex2) need an ordered list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and end? >> linked list
ex3) web scraping nested HTML? >> tree
ex4) need to write a schedular? >> binary heap
